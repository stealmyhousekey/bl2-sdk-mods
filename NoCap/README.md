### a pythonsdk lobby extension mod by stelmo 

shoutouts to [Robeth](https://github.com/RobethX) for his previous unlimited coop mod and documentation

#### Requires: [UserFeedback by apple1417](https://bl-sdk.github.io/mods/UserFeedback/)

### Recommended:
- Download a copy of [Robeth's cooppatch.txt](https://github.com/RobethX/BL2-MP-Mods/blob/latest-csharp/CoopPatch/cooppatch.txt), and enable FIXES using OpenBLCMM (and any desired in the OPTIONS category)

- Do NOT enable CORE or NETWORK OPTIMIZATION

- HOST: exec your customized cooppatch.txt at the main menu each launch


### Usage:
##### All players must have the mod installed and working
- HOST
    - Set desired number of teams (and any other misc options) at the main menu [Options > Mods > NoCap] 
    - Start the game SOLO
    - Tell clients whenever you have loaded in
- CLIENTS
    - Wait until host tells you to join
    - Join game
        - main menu join may fail, try connecting via Steam/Epic if so
    - Join a team
        - NOTE: if Team 1 fills, the game will no longer be joinable
    - Play as normal

### Settings:
- Number of Teams
    - how many teams are allowed in-game (host-controlled)
- Network Tweaks
    - optimize network settings for more than 4 players
- Max Scaling
    - always scale lobby to 4 players, even if team 1 has fewer
- Logging
    - enable console debug logging

### Disclaimer:
This mod has only been tested with 5-7 players, so the 32 player limit is UNCONFIRMED as of now.   
The teams all appear to function correctly however, so I see no reason to believe it shouldn't work. 

### Known Issues:
 - All of the same issues reported [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1151711689) will likely apply to this mod as well
